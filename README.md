Alekss Noviƒçonoks Compulsory Assignment

  Hi Alex!

  96% of user stories are done, but there are few unit tests and server-side validation.

  update: Server-side validation was added to both orders and papers.

  There is no option to create properties,you need to add them in db manually,but they are displayed tho..

  There is also strange thing i caught today is that when creating a paper it goes to white screen and you need to reload it manually.

  There is also a problem with sorting papers which somehow arose and went unnoticed in my git pushes...It did work somewhere in mid 15 commits,so if you are willing to test it out its somewhere there :)

Other then that i think everything works as supposed to.Lack of Unit tests is mybad.......................
